        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s</p>

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience.


            Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger than things farther away, we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.
            
            
            The illusion has been long adopted into parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic effect. Its first use was in traditional animation, dating back to as early as Disneyâ€™s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and in video games such as Super Mario. 
            
            
            With advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax effects later evolved into the world of web design as we know it today.
            
            
            Here are nine outstanding parallax scrolling examples built with Wix, handpicked for your web design inspiration:

    <h2>Section Three</h2>
    <p>Emilie De Grosbois, a Montreal-based visual artist and the founder of Mild Design, can show us a thing or two about how to make a portfolio. Her own portfolio website strikes visitors with an impressive welcome: a series of intricate fullscreen images displayed in a long scroll. These are some of the best website images we've seen. 


        By use of parallax, the transition from one image to the next becomes not only smoother, but it also adds a sense of depth, as if the images gently glide on top of each other.
